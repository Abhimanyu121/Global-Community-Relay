## OFEX


## Project Summary
Ofex is protocol for trustless derivative contract and cryptocurrency trading. The basic idea is that OFEX nodes just find other party to your transfer/trade. Users don't need to trust OFEX nodes, they can see if nodes try to cheat and moneys are all time in users wallet and user is only one who knows the private key. Every node can run their own orderbooks and nodes are watching orderbooks of other nodes to see if they try to cheat in some way. User can choose about which orderbook he uses. Nodes are also watching if there is match to your order in different orderbook, then you can cancel your order and make new order in orderbook where is match to your order. This way OFEX is fast as centralized exchanges, but is still decentralized and trustless. In addition to these benefits, there are derivatives in OFEX. Everyone can create their own derivative contract and provide price API for underlying asset. How transfers are made, if user is only one who have privatekey and OFEX don't interact with any blockchain? When OFEX node have found match to you, you make transaction that other party can spend when he have done his transaction. if other party don't make transaction, you get your moneys back, because timelock, and karma of other party decsrease, so no one want to make transactions with him anymore. So you can avoid trading partners that do not make the transfer, you can decide minium karma of other party. There is two milestones of journey to get OFEX ready to use. Last milestone target day is 10.3.2020 and then OFEX should be rady to use.
