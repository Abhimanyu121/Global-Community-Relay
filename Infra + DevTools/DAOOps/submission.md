# Submission for the Labs Infra + DevTools Bounties

## DAOOps

## Summary
DAOOps is a set of practices that aims to systematize DAO functionalities such as resource management, decision-making processes, and membership lifecycles. The concept emerged through the development of Abridged and the tireless work James Young placed on developing a system for seamless onboarding for no-coiners. DAOOps brings the power of the blockchain into applications with existing networks, we built a system that allows for users to spin up a DAO extremely simply, through a familiar chat interface (telegram, slack, discord, facebook messenger, etc).

Very simply, a DAO is a means of online resource coordination. The fundamental building block looks like a multisg, allowing for multiple people/entities to transparently control and make decisions for the distribution of funds. 

Despite years of work, we seem to be far away from the reality of these types of coordination mechanisms to affect the general population. This comes down to blockchain interfaces and UX... the population of users on decentralized applications today comes to only 0.01% of the population using Facebook everyday... this is a testament to the state of onboarding, and retention experienced by users today.

Even for the communities in the ecosystem using DAO protocols, there is a lack of participation due to friction involved with the interface... this is where DAOOps comes in.

There are a variety of ways this technology can be used and we are in the process of building out various flows to provide different templates for particular situations.
