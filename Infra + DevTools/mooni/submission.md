## Project Name

# üåö Mooni
> Simple crypto cash out

## Project Summary

**Mooni** is a simple solution for end-users, marketplaces or DAOs to cash out cryptos in fiat directly to a bank account.

What we propose is an all-in-one solution for quickly cashing out cryptos, provided as a web app usable by anyone, that can also be included in any other app.
Such a solution reduce friction, accelerate crypto adoption and lead conversion, as it would reassure people that they can exit anytime by selling the cryptos they just bought or earned.


We provide a Javascript SDK which helps dApp BUIDLers to integrate Mooni features into any web application in one line of code.

Crypto<>Fiat exchange is using [bity.com](https://bity.com), which is a well-established Swiss crypto/fiat gateway, with strong regulations rules. Anonymous and non-KYCed users are allowed up to 5,000 CHF (~$5,070) per year.
